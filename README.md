# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game in which players take turns marking X or O in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

This project is a Python implementation of Tic Tac Toe that can be played in the command line. The game includes the following features:

A welcome message and instructions for the players.
A function to display the game board in the command line.
A function for each player to choose their marker, either X or O.
A function to randomly choose which player goes first.
A function to check if a player has won the game.
A function to check if the game board is full.
A function for players to choose their next move.
A function to ask if the players want to play again after the game ends.
To play the game, simply run the Python script in your command line. Players will take turns entering their move by choosing a position on the 3x3 grid. The game will continue until a player wins or the board is full.

Have fun playing Tic Tac Toe!
